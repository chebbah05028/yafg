# yafg - Yet Another Frequency Generator
Very simple Frequency Generator for testing CNC Motor/Driver/Axis written in C using the arduino IDE.
The implementation provides generating signal for up to three axis. 
Used for testing mechanics/motors/driver during CNC construction.

### Basic information:
* applies the Arduino Nano platform (ATMega328P)
* generates pulses for driving 3 axis
* two press buttons per axis (left/right motor turn direction)
* potentiometer for adjusting speed/signal freqeuncy (approx 100Hz to 5KHz).
